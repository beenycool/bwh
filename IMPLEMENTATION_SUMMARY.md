  - Distance-based threat assessment
- Three-tier alert system: Approach Warning ‚Üí Possible Rush ‚Üí Critical Rush
- Configurable threat thresholds and cooldowns

### ‚úÖ **In-Game Alert Customization**
- Per-alert type customization with `AlertCustomization` class:
  - Individual sound settings (on/off, volume, type)
  - Text color customization per alert category  
  - Display toggle options (chat/overlay/both)
  - Priority levels for alert ordering
- Sound types: default, warning, critical with volume scaling

### ‚úÖ **Per-Player/Mute System**
- Player muting stored in configuration with persistence
- Smart mute toggle via keybind (look at player and press J)
- Mute list management with add/remove/clear functionality
- Automatic filtering in ItemDetector to skip muted players

### ‚úÖ **Alert History Panel**
- Persistent alert tracking with timestamps
- Scrollable history panel showing last 50 alerts

  - Scoreboard analysis with async processing
  - Color code extraction from formatted text
  - Rank prefix removal for clean player names
- Enhanced teammate filtering with fallback mechanisms

### ‚úÖ **Async Processing**
- `AsyncProcessor` utility for performance optimization:
  - Heavy scoreboard processing moved to background threads
  - Trajectory calculations performed asynchronously
  - Callbacks executed safely on main thread
  - Thread pool management with daemon threads

### ‚úÖ **Auto-Update Checker**
- `UpdateChecker` with GitHub API integration:
  - Automatic version comparison against releases
  - Smart cooldown to prevent excessive API calls
  - User notification with download links
  - Manual check capability for immediate updates

### ‚úÖ **Advanced Diagnostics**
- Comprehensive `DiagnosticsPanel` with real-time monitoring:
  - FPS tracking with color-coded health indicators
  - Memory usage (heap and total) with percentage display
  - Thread count monitoring
  - Performance impact estimation based on enabled features
  - Entity/player count tracking
  - Network connection status

### ‚úÖ **Test Mode**
- Full `TestMode` implementation for development and validation:
  - Automatic scenario simulation with realistic scenarios
  - Manual scenario triggering for specific situations
  - All alert types testable (TNT, pearls, rush, armor, etc.)
  - Sequence testing with async delays
  - Sound and visual feedback validation

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture Improvements**
